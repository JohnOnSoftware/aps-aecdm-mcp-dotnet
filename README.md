# aps-aecdm-mcp-dotnet
.NET MCP Server to connect with Autodesk Assistant or Claude Desktop, AEC Data Model API including the Geometry feature(beta) and the Viewer.


## Introduction
This project started as an experiment with the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) during an [Autodesk Platform Accelerator](https://aps.autodesk.com/accelerator-program). 

It continues as a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) local server implementation that enables AI Agency to interact with APS **AEC Data Model** with either **stdio** or **Streamable HTTP** communication as follow:
- Claude Desktop by **stdio** communication
- Autodesk Assistant by **Streamable HTTP** communication

The MCP server provides natural language access models from Autodesk Construction Cloud data, do clash detection, spatial analysis, and 3D visualization capabilities.

## Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** - OAuth token management for APS API access
- 🏗️ **BIM Navigation** - Browse hubs, projects, and element groups
- 🔍 **Element Querying** - Filter and retrieve building elements by category
- 📤 **IFC Export** - Export filtered elements to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format
- ⚠️ **Clash Detection** - Accurate geometric clash detection using bounding box analysis
- 📦 **Spatial Containment** - Find elements spatially contained within other elements
- 📁 **File Upload** - Upload files to Autodesk Docs (ACC/BIM 360)
- 👁️ **3D Visualization** - Render and highlight elements in Autodesk Viewer
- 🔌 **Dual Transport** - STDIO mode and Streamable HTTP mode

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or higher
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (for local AI assistant integration)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

### Autodesk Platform Services

- An APS account (free at [aps.autodesk.com](https://aps.autodesk.com))
- An APS application with:
  - **App Type**: Single Page Application is recommended(for PKCE authentication)
  - **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback/`
  - **APIs Enabled**: Data Management API, AEC Data Model API, Model Derivative API
- Access to ACC (Autodesk Construction Cloud) projects
- Access to Autodesk Assistant staging version

### Provisioning

- **Important**: You must [provision your APS app in your ACC hub](https://get-started.aps.autodesk.com/#provision-access-in-other-products) to access project data.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnOnSoftware/aps-aecdm-mcp-dotnet.git
cd aps-aecdm-mcp-dotnet
```

## Setup

### 1. Set Environment Variables

You need to configure your APS credentials as environment variables, or you can set these in `Properties/launchSettings.json`:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "mcp-server-aecdm": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "your_aps_pkce_client_id",
        "CALLBACK_URL": "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Running with AI Agent
#### Claude Desktop

- To connect this MCP server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "aecdm": {
        "command": "dotnet",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--project",
          "C:\\path-to-your-folder\\...mcp-server-aecdm.csproj",
          "--no-build"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Build the project with `dotnet build` 
- Run Claude Desktop and enable the MCP server **aecdm**
- Play with it.

####  Autodesk Assistant(Staging, Autodesk Internal Only)
- Build the project with `dotnet build`
- Run the App with `dotnet run --http` 
- Open the browser without CORS, for Chrome please refer [here](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/#google_vignette)
- Test in the browser by `http://127.0.0.1:4000/mcp/health`, you should get the status of this MCP server.
- Run Autodesk Assistant if everything is good, enable MCP.
- Play with it.


## Workflow Scenario from AI agent
- Please find my design "Sample.rvt" from ACC project "Sample Project”, and render it in the viewer.
- Show me all the stairs in the design and highlight them.
- Now list me all the rooms from this design.
- Please check last 5 stairs and tell me which are inside room "Stair S1”.
- Highlight the contained stairs in the viewer.
- Please export all the Doors from this design to IFC file with file name “DoorsSample”
- Upload this IFC file to Autodesk Docs, under same project. 

## Troubleshooting
- Can't find my hub -- **Solution**: Ensure your APS app is [provisioned in your ACC hub](https://get-started.aps.autodesk.com/#provision-access-in-other-products). This must be done by an ACC administrator.
- Code changes not reflected in Claude -- **Solution**: Completely quit Claude Desktop (check Task Manager/Activity Monitor), Rebuild your project: `dotnet build`, Restart Claude Desktop
- Port conflicts (8081/8082), Viewer tools fail if ports are already in use --**Solution**: Close applications using these ports or modify port numbers in `ViewerTool.cs`.
- Element IDs vs File Version URNs, Some tools require element group IDs, not file version URNs -- **Solution**: Use the ID from `GetElementGroupsByProject`, not the `fileVersionUrn` field.
